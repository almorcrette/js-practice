# JS Practice

In this repo Alexis Morcrette builds up solutions the challenges in [Makers Academy](http://makers.tech)'s JavaScript Fundamentals syllabus. This is the focus of Week 6 of the Makers Academy curriculum.

The challenges were solved by pair programming with peers in my cohort throughout the week.

## Learning objectives

By completing this syllabus, I learned to:
* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking
  programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Outline of content covered

I covered the basics of JavaScript:
1. [Running JavaScript](./running_javascript/)
2. [Running files](./running_files/)
3. [Variables and visibility](./variables_and_visibility/)
4. [Functions](./functions/)
5. [Conditionals](./conditionals/)
6. [Loops](./loops/)
7. [Functions as values](./functions_as_values/)
8. [Callbacks](./callbacks/)
9. [Arrays](./arrays/)
10. [Objects](./objects/)
11. [Array operations](./array_operations/)
12. [Classes](./classes/)

I also learned how to use JavaScript in a real application, including *unit tests*, *multiple classes*, and *external dependencies on packages and remote APIs*.

1. [Testing with Jest](./testing-in-jest/)
2. [A Search function](./search_function-project/)
